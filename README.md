# hooklabChallenge
These are three challenges I participated in for a job at Hooklab. On WebScrapingReddit I made a code for webscraping some information from Reddit and put the information in informations_reddit.csv, on WebScrapingFilmes I made a code with three functions to calculate different ratings on movies!
